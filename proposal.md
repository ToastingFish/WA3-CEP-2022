# General description of project
> Building a game assistent system that evaluates the character build and the team build

#Goals of project
> - Provide a evaluation based on the characters' basics stats, weapons and artifacts equiped.
> - Allow user to input information on up to 4 characters to form a team
> - Allow user to modify the actions of the characters in the timeline to suit the playstyle of the users
> - Provided a detailed timeline with the DMG (damage) per frame to showcase the strength of the above team build.


# Listing of features
> - A database that covers all common characters and weapons
> - Input system that handles all the characters stats from user input and provide a review based on the charcters stats
> - Simulates the characters' stats based on the inputs
> - An action timeline feature that allowes user to input their desired damage output methods
> - Providing a detailed feeback on the team damage output based on the characters and the action timeline

# External Scanning
> There a currently no such applications or webpages that is able to calculate and evaluate the damage output of an entire team (4 characters) but there are such websites that is able to calculate the 1-hit damage of a single character.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> As GI is a mostly single-player game, and there is no ranking or pvp system, players does have have an idea if their character and team is considered good or bad
> Obtaining new characters in GI is quite difficult for free-to-play players and they may want to evaluate them in such simulators to evaluate their benefits in users' prefered team set-up before choosing to obtain them or not (which cannot be done in the game itself)

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> - Setting up a database that have assingned values for the system to obtain them
> - Formatting the result output in an excel document/spreadsheet.
